Thomas Torku and Cruz Jean will work on more-rigorous statistical analysis of the performance of all models. This includes the creation of a uniform benchmark; the results of which will be used in the Paper to compare the performance of all constructed models. We will also start working on the Paper: Introduction - Thomas and Paul, Background - Ryan and Hunter, Methodology - Cruz and Je long, Results and Discussion - Cruz and Thomas."
